  Brute force requires checking every possible strategy to find the most optimal
  Brute forcing is a method in hacking (and apparently computer chess simulation) that means to run every possibility of a problem until the program finds the best solution.

  artificial neural networks, which mimic human learning
  The learning process involved the computer playing itself, and then calculating whether it would win or not based on its next move.
